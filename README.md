# wind-up-warrior

Wind-Up Warrior is a side-scrolling action RPG game I developed for mobile, which was released mid-year 2017. It was built using [AppGameKit](https://www.appgamekit.com/), which you will need to compile and run the project. I am releasing this as a potential educatory source for newer AGK developers - be warned, this was the first major project completed with AGK and the code is spaghetti.

You can download Wind-Up Warrior to play on an Android device on [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=au.com.joyforge.wuw).

## What's in the repo?

The repo contains source files (main.agc and wind-up-warrior.agk) and media (sprites, sfx) required to compile and run the project.

In the interest of other parties, I have removed the music from the game, and replaced it with silence. References in the code to AdMob and Chartboost ID keys, GameCenter ID's, In-App Purchase keys and other sensitive information has been removed from the code.

## Known Issues

To note, there are a handful of bugs which I never worked

- Despite there being several 'Chaos' weapons, only 1 would ever drop
- For some users, the game would crash after beating the final boss
- Occasionally, the HP bar of an enemy will not appear when engaging them
- Rarely, and seemingly randomly, a hit may not register on an enemy
